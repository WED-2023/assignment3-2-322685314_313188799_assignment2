Changes to the OpenAPI Specification:

Schemas:
- Removed redundant schemas like `RecipePreview` and `RecipePreviewInUser` to simplify the model definitions.
- Added new, relevant schemas such as `user_favorited_recipes` and `FamilyRecipes` to better reflect current functionality.

Route Structure Updates:
- Changed `/me` to `/user` for a more intuitive and RESTful path name.
- Registration and login endpoints are now accessible directly from the home path (`/`).
- Search functionality is now accessed through the `/recipes` route for clearer organization.

New Functionality:
- Added logout functionality at the `/Logout` route.
- Introduced `/inLoggedIn` endpoint to assist frontend testing of login state.
- Added `/recipes/LastSearched` GET endpoint to retrieve the user's recent search history.
- Added a GET method to fetch a specific userâ€™s recipe by `recipeID`.
- Added a GET method to retrieve the user's last 3 watched recipes.
- Added a POST method to increase the number of likes by recipeID.

Modifications:
- Changed the `/user/watch` method from `PUT` to `POST` for proper REST semantics.
- Removed the outdated `/user/watch/remove` functionality to reduce API clutter.
